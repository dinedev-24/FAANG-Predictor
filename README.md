# FAANG-Predictor

**FAANG-Predictor** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the closing prices of FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) using regression models. This project combines **data preprocessing**, **machine learning**, **MLflow integration**, and a user-friendly **Streamlit web application** to provide financial analysts and retail investors with intelligent insights into stock price trends.

## 📋 **Project Objective**
Develop a Streamlit web application that predicts FAANG stock closing prices based on historical data and user inputs. The application is designed to:
- Simplify data-driven decisions for financial analysts and investors.
- Provide accurate regression-based stock price predictions.
- Enable exploratory data analysis (EDA) and performance visualization.
